Extensions: I created the "GET /api/posts/author/{username}/" that gets all of the posts for a user
with the specified username. I made a test method for this in the test.py file that checks that this list is not empty for the user "Megan" and that every post in the list is authored by Megan.

Comments: This was again a nice assignment. I really appreciate you guys breaking this stuff down into small, manageable pieces.
